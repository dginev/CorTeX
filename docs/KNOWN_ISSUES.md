## Dispatcher / pipeline

| # | Sev | Status | Issue |
|---|---|---|---|
| D-1 | S1 | 🟢 | **Per-event connection/thread storm in `worker_metadata` — fixed.** `record_*` formerly opened a fresh `PgConnection` *and* spawned a detached thread per ZMQ event; under load this exhausted `max_connections` + ephemeral ports and **crashed the process** (proven, `RESOURCE_RATIONALIZATION.md`). #4 pooled the connection; this arm replaces the per-event spawn with a **single background writer** (`start_metadata_writer`) fed by a bounded, non-blocking `sync_channel` — **O(1) threads** regardless of dispatch rate, ≤1 metadata connection in use at a time, sends never block the dispatch hot loop, and a saturated queue drops (rather than OOMs or stalls). The ventilator/sink hold a cloneable `WorkerMetadataSender`; the writer exits when all senders drop. |
| D-2 | S2 | 🟢 | **Metadata read-before-insert race — fixed.** `record_received` did find-then-update and silently dropped the count when the sink's write outran the ventilator's insert; with no uniqueness, concurrent inserts could also duplicate rows. Now both writers **upsert** (`INSERT … ON CONFLICT (name, service_id) DO UPDATE`) via synchronous `upsert_dispatched`/`upsert_received` helpers — order-independent, no dropped counts, one row per worker (migration `20260613160000` adds `UNIQUE(name, service_id)` after a one-time dedupe). Failures now `eprintln!` instead of `.unwrap_or(0)` swallowing them. Unit-tested (out-of-order + accumulation). The thread-per-event spawn is still unbounded — see D-1. |
| D-3 | S1 | 🔴 | **`.expect()`/`.unwrap()`/`panic!` on dispatch paths.** `connection_at` does `establish(...).expect(...)`; the ventilator does `.bind().unwrap()`; sink/finalize/manager `panic!` on thread errors. Any of these turns a transient fault into a crash or a silently-dead thread. Violates principle #2. Fix: convert to `Result` + log + continue; reserve panics for true invariants. (Note: the `establish` error message is also a **bug** — `"Error connecting to {address}"` is a literal, the `{address}` is never interpolated.) |
| D-4 | S2 | 🔴 | **Ventilator empty-message fragility** (pre-existing, code-commented). A rare "3 adjacent empty messages" mode permanently shuffles ROUTER state; the manager works around it by **restarting the ventilator thread in a loop**. Needs a root-cause fix, not a restart band-aid. |
| D-5 | S2 | 🔴 | **`job_limit` lockstep termination hangs.** With a finite `job_limit`, mock-replies (taskid 0 when the queue momentarily empties) desync the ventilator/sink/finalize counters, so the pipeline can **hang on shutdown** (hit while writing `bench_pipeline.rs`). Clean, deterministic drain/shutdown is missing. |
| D-6 | S2 | 🟢 | **Dispatch backpressure — implemented (2026-06-13).** Previously the metadata fan-out was bounded (D-1) but nothing bounded the **in-flight task set**: the ventilator fire-and-forgot, and `progress_queue` could only grow until the hard `PROGRESS_QUEUE_HARD_LIMIT` (10k) **panic** — i.e. crash, not degrade. Now the ventilator applies **backpressure** (principle #4): when in-flight ≥ `DispatcherConfig::max_in_flight` (default 5000, well under the 10k hard bound — an invariant asserted in `server::tests`), it stops leasing and mock-replies so workers back off and retry; the set then drains as the sink receives results, holding steady instead of growing to the panic. The two magic 10k bounds are now the named `PROGRESS_QUEUE_HARD_LIMIT` / `DONE_QUEUE_HARD_LIMIT` constants (the hard backstop behind the soft backpressure). Unit-tested (`in_flight_saturated` boundary, the below-hard-limit invariant, `progress_queue_len` dispatch/drain); `echo_roundtrip` (full dispatcher) green. **Residual (lower-risk):** timeout reaping of crashed-worker tasks is still coupled to the refetch path (`task_queue.is_empty()`), so a fully-wedged in-flight set recovers slowly via the 1h timeout rather than promptly; decoupling the reaper is a future refinement, not unbounded growth. |
| D-7 | S3 | 🔴 | **Single sink thread does blocking result-archive writes** to slow `/data` QLC RAID6 — serialises I/O at high task rates. Tracked as Arm 14 #1/#2 (NVMe staging + optional write thread-pool). |
| D-8 | S3 | 🔴 | **`mark_done` blind delete+reinsert** of all five `log_*` tables per task on every finalize, even when logs are unchanged — write amplification on the hot path. Tracked as Arm 14 #3 (diff/upsert). |

## Worker / task handling

| # | Sev | Status | Issue |
|---|---|---|---|
| W-1 | S1 | 🔴 | **No per-task timeout / resource cap at the worker boundary.** `latexml-oxide` can hang, OOM, or segfault on hostile input; nothing here time-boxes or memory-caps a task or guards against decompression bombs / oversized results. Retry budget exists in the ventilator but task-level isolation does not. Principles #3, #6. |
| W-2 | S3 | 🔴 | **Non-UTF-8 / malformed worker logs** are handled ad hoc in `generate_report` (defaults to Fatal). Needs a single, well-tested tolerant log parser as the contract with unpredictable workers. |
| W-3 | S4 | 🟡 | **Worker identity is self-assigned** (`hostname:service:pid`-style), overriding the configured `identity` field — fine today, but means metadata keys are not operator-controlled. |

## Reports / storage

| # | Sev | Status | Issue |
|---|---|---|---|
| R-1 | S2 | 🟢 | **Hard Redis dependency for reports — removed.** Aggregate reports were O(millions of log rows) shielded by a Redis cache (staleness + an extra daemon). Arm 14 #6 replaced it with the `report_summary` materialized view: **#6.1** the read model + matview + contract test; **#6.2** wired `task_report`'s category/`what` grains to the rollup (`category_grain_from_rollup`/`what_grain_from_rollup`, sharing `aux_task_rows_stats` with — and pinned equivalent to — the retained live `task_report_live`), refreshes it on the run-completion path (finalize **drain + at-least-daily**, plus `mark_new_run`), and **dropped the `redis` crate** (`cache_worker` + the boot `.expect()` are gone — the frontend now boots without Redis). |
| R-4 | S3 | 🔴 | **`report_summary` uses non-concurrent `REFRESH`** (brief `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock). The refresh cadence is now run-completion **plus at-least-daily** while long runs are in flight (a single conversion run can take weeks; `finalize.rs`), so the lock is taken more often — `REFRESH ... CONCURRENTLY` (needs a UNIQUE index disambiguating the ROLLUP `NULL`s, e.g. on `category_is_total`/`what_is_total` + `NULLS NOT DISTINCT`, PG15+) is the follow-up. |
| R-2 | S3 | 🟢 | **`tasks.entry` length cap — widened.** It was `varchar(200)`; a longer source-archive path didn't truncate, it **errored on insert** ("value too long") so the document was silently lost to processing. Migration `20260613170000` widens it to `varchar(4096)` (a Linux PATH_MAX path) — a catalog-only change (no table rewrite, no rebuild of the seven `entry` indexes), safe on the large `tasks` table. Regression-tested (`tests/long_entry_test.rs`). |
| R-3 | S4 | 🟡 | **Stringly-typed report internals.** The **agent contract** is now typed: `frontend/reports.rs` serves `GET /api/reports/<corpus>/<service>/<severity>[/<category>]` as `CategoryReportDto`/`WhatReportDto`/`ReportRowDto` straight off the rollup (paginated, severity-validated). **Still open:** the live `task_report` path that feeds the HTML templates returns `Vec<HashMap<String,String>>` internally — fine for Tera, but worth typing when the legacy report routes migrate into the library. |

## Tooling / environment

| # | Sev | Status | Issue |
|---|---|---|---|
| E-1 | S4 | 🟡 | **CI refreshed to current requirements** (`/.github/workflows/CI.yml`): Postgres + roles, nightly via `dtolnay/rust-toolchain` (the `actions-rs/*` actions are archived), diesel_cli 2.x migrations on both DBs, **no Redis**, and `fmt --check` + `clippy -D warnings` gates mirroring `.githooks/`. **Still pending:** publishing API docs + rustdoc to GH Pages (Arm 9/12), and the L-1 teardown flake can still red the run. |
| E-2 | S4 | 🟢 | *(dev-env note, not a product bug)* The sandbox's seccomp filter kills a process that polls `pg_stat_activity` in a tight loop (SIGSTKFLT) and the harness's background-run wrapper signals long jobs — so in-sandbox load tests must run foreground without a live connection sampler. Recorded so the next session doesn't re-discover it. |

## Frontend / routes

| # | Sev | Status | Issue |
|---|---|---|---|
| F-1 | S2 | 🟢 | **RESOLVED (2026-06-13).** The binary's `diff_historical_summary`/`diff_historical_tasks` routes did `NaiveDateTime::parse_from_str(date).unwrap()` on a user-supplied query param (a malformed date **panicked the request**), `.expect()`ed the `previous_status`/`current_status` params (a missing status panicked), and `.unwrap()`ed `from_key` (an unknown status panicked) — all input-triggerable dispatch-path panics (violates principle #2). **Both routes + their `diff-summary`/`diff-history` templates are now deleted**, replaced by full library twins (agent + human) that parse gracefully: the matrix (`runs::api_run_diff` + HTML `runs::runs_diff_page`) and the drill-down (`runs::api_run_task_diffs` + HTML `runs::runs_tasks_page`) all return `400` on a malformed/unknown date *or* status, `404` on unknown corpus/service, empty = no filter. The orphaned `DiffRequestParams` + three `TemplateContext` diff fields + the two now-callerless `Backend::{list,summary}_task_diffs` wrapper methods were pruned with them. `report.html.tera`'s "Diff previous runs" link repointed at `/runs/<corpus>/<service>/diff`. **Residual (lower-risk, NOT input-triggered — folded into D-3's "request-path unwrap" audit):** `bin/frontend.rs` still has `service.select_workers(...).unwrap()` (a DB-query unwrap on the worker_report path). *(The history-path `serde_json::to_string(...).unwrap()` was resolved when that route moved to the library as `runs::history_page` — softened to `unwrap_or_default()`.)* |

## Process lifecycle / shutdown

| # | Sev | Status | Issue |
|---|---|---|---|
| L-1 | S2 | 🔴 | **Flaky at-exit SIGSEGV in DB-pool processes.** Integration binaries that build a Rocket `Client` over an r2d2/libpq pool (and the `jobs::spawn_job` detached-thread path) intermittently SIGSEGV **during process teardown, after all their tests pass**. Reproduced on a clean `master` checkout (so pre-existing, not from the rollup/Redis work): ~3–5 of 5 runs for `jobs_api_test` / `management_api_test`, and **never under gdb** → a thread/connection teardown-ordering race, not a logic bug. It aborts `cargo test` (and can red CI) even though the assertions passed; the bench works around the same class with `process::exit(0)`. Fix is clean shutdown: join spawned job threads and drop the pool before exit rather than racing detached threads against libpq teardown (no unbounded detached threads — principles #1/#3). |
